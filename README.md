# Battle_Plane_Game
Year 2 Information Processing Project
- Developed a real-time video game using PyGame. 
- Used Quartus and Eclipse to design an accelerometer NIOS II system that could use an FPGA board as a game controller.
- Recorded and stored relevant game data on the AWS cloud server.
- wrote python scripts to process the data such as best scores and history scores and then sent back to the game for display.
